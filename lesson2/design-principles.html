            This shows the principles of Proximity. The site clearly 
            distinguish all related content. For our case here, Low Cost and Online. 
            They emphasized what they mean by gathering some
            other elements with it.

            I use this a lot to search for music to play on the piano. What i love the most is how it 
            represents alignment. As we look at the music sheet and the descriptions, we can feel that the Design
            is clean because of how good they are aligned. 
            It's amazing.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>

          <figcaption>
            Upwork is one of my favorites site. Though on phone or computer. After visiting the site,
            It pleases your eyes to see the color used.
            I don't know if it is just me but the green and white get along pretty well.
            The two button used there shows the importance of contrast and its role in our design.
